# Inside The Dark

A DDLC mod to let you experience the worst part of DDLC and inside the code

This is a mod that made by [DDLCModTemplate](https://github.com/Monika-After-Story/DDLCModTemplate) by Monika After Story Team. Great thanks.

## WARNING

This game is an unofficial fan work, unaffiliated with Team Salvato.

This mod is STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. It may contains lots of bugs and incompleted parts.

It is designed to be played only after the official game has been completed, and contains **SPOILERS** for the official game.

And this mod contains something **HORROR** from original DDLC games, so it is **not suitable for children or they are easily distrubed**. More detail can be viewed at https://ddlc.moe/warning.html (with spoilers).

**YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.**

## Getting Started

### Into code or contribute
Follow these steps to get into the code.

1. Download and install the [Ren'Py SDK version 6.99.12](https://www.renpy.org/release/6.99.12). *(NOTE: The current version of DDLC is not compatible with .rpyc files generated with other versions of the Renpy SDK)*
2. Clone this repo or just download a ZIP.
3. Place the files in the Ren'py working directory (chosen during installation).
4. Download the DDLC files (available for free at http://ddlc.moe) & drop the `audio.rpa`, `images.rpa`, and `fonts.rpa` files from it into the /game directory. (Do **not** include the `scripts.rpa` file, as this will create conflicts.)
5. Launch the project in Ren'Py. It should compile & run.
6. If you want to build a release version, navigate the Ren'Py menu & select "Build Distributions", then check "DDLC Compatible Mod" and build the mod. This will create a cross-platform .ZIP file with files for the mod & installation instructions.

### Just play it

I haven't decided to make a release, as it is still incompleted.

comingsoon...
